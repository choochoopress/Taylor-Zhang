    <label for="tab-1">Hello</label>
    <div class="tab-content">
        <p>I am a New York based writer and editor, currently pursuing a MFA in nonfiction at Columbia University.</p>

        <p>I’ve facilitated a weekly writing workshop at the Manhattan Detention Complex, taught a craft seminar to high school students, and led an undergraduate nonfiction workshop. As of late, I conduct research and write obituaries for MISSING THEM, compose haibuns using open sourced text, and freelance copywrite. I am currently at work on a book of essays about consumer capitalism of the past two decades.</p>
        
        <p>When not writing or teaching, I also run <a href="http://choochoopress.com/" target="_blank">Choo Choo Press</a>, a small Risograph zine press, with my friend Emily Bluedorn. She made the painting to the left, which shows me walking around in Brooklyn the year I decided to move to the city to write. I now live fifteen minutes away from this street.</p>
        
        <p>Other non-literary interests and pleasures include: diners (Waffle House counts), desserts of almost every variety, artistic collaboration, going to the movies, and Hawaiian shirts.</p>
